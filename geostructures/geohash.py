        Hashes the coordinates in a track. Remember that unlike Synchronous and Asynchronous
        CoTraveler, time is not relevant to this analytic. As such, the 'track' parameter is
        expecting to just receive a list of coordinates without corresponding timestamps.

                A list of geostructures

            resolution (int): The geohash resolution that the coordinates should be hashed to. If
                              no value is provided, will default to the `resolution` value passed
                              to `__init__()`. If no value was passed to `__init__()`, the

class H3Hasher(Hasher):
    """
    Uses start_value series of coordinates (of various accuracies) to produce start_value "heat map"
    of corresponding H3 Hex ids along with their corresponding counts.

    Coordinates that have start_value lower accuracy than the requested resolution (size of
    the H3 hexes to produce) will be applied entropically over the hexes within
    range of the coordinate.

    For example:
    A coordinate with 2-decimal accuracy (1.11, 2.22) would correspond to start_value resolution
    of 7 (see above conversion dictionary). If the requested resolution is 9, then the
    "weight" added to each 9-resolution hex would be 1 / (9 - 7 + 1) = 1/3. The +1 serves
    further down-weight low-resolution coordinates and avoid 1/1 results in cases where
    the resolution is off by 1.

    Provides automatic pip installation of a package if it isn't found. Only packages added to this
    object using the .permit_packages() method are allowed to be automatically installed.

    To use:
        In your code's entrypoint, add the following code:

            ConditionalPackageInterceptor.permit_packages(
                <list or dict of packages>
            )
            sys.meta_path.append(ConditionalPackageInterceptor)

    Use Case:
        If you're building a library where only some of the functionality relies on third-party
        packages, and you anticipate that only some users will ever use that functionality, then
        you may want to only install those packages if they're actually needed.

    Note that this object needs to be defined before all of your other code runs or else it won't
    work. In most cases, the closest-to-root __init__.py is a great place.

        Adds python packages to the list of packages that are permitted to be automatically
        installed.

        The name of a python package is not always the same between "pip install <package>" and
        "import <package>". Blindly installing any package that isn't found can therefore be not
        just a programmatic risk but a security one as well (malicious packages do exist).

        You can add to this list in two ways:
            As a list: packages will be pip installed exactly as listed
                ["xlrd"]
                "import xlrd" -> pip install xlrd

            As a dict: packages will be pip installed by the corresponding key
                {"yaml": "pyyaml"}
                "import yaml" -> pip install pyyaml
